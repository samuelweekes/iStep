# iStep

Group project from MSc Software Development.

The project uses the fact that many modern phones have in-built accelerometers to make a pedometer.

I was responsible mainly for the step-counting feature of the app, which at it's most basic levels takes positional values from the
accelerometer and tries to work out if a change in movement consitutes a step..
